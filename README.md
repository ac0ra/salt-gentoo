==============

###Notes###
This is a repository that configures a standalone Salt-Minion (masterless) on Gentoo for the purpose of system configuration 
and packages that should be installed. I built this for myself in order to simplify the process of building or re-building 
Gentoo clients, but anyone is welcome to use it.

###Hardware###
This Gentoo configuration is for an HP EliteBook 740 laptop running Gentoo/XFCE.
